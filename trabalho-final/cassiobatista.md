## Task 1: Translation on Hugo Academic Template
Hugo is a framework based on Google's Go language for building static pages in
GitHub or GitLab. Among the several templates already created to make
developer's lives easier, there is the Academic template (check 
[this](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) and
[this](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) 
links), which has a typical layout of an online CV. My accepted contribution in
in [PR 1121](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/pull/1121) was to
translate most of the Brazilian Portuguese stuff that goes in HTML hyperlinks.
